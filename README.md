# Vimvincible

[Deployed here]()

Welcome to our final team at Makers. At the current stage of development, 8 working days were spent planning, developing, and implementing before a feature freeze, with two further working days to tidying up code. For a detailed account of the agile working environment and the sprints involved in this project, please visit [the team wiki](https://github.com/RaeRachael/invimcible_front_end/wiki), with the additional [back end wiki](https://github.com/tristanlangford/invimcible_back_end/wiki).

## What is Vimvincible?

This is a topdown <b>educational</b> role play game that follows a character, Vim Bishop, as he looks for his bike.
* Vim can be moved around the levels using the vim commands 'hjkl' in place of arrows keys. 
* The second level allows Vim's character to jump over potholes using the vim command 'w' to jump to the left, mimicking the vim command that allows users to jump to the end of a sentence.

We hope that Vimcincible will provide a fun way for users to become more vim proficient.
